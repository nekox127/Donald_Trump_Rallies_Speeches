       "\"thank you very much everybody thank you wow i will never ever let you down that i can tell you amazing and i want to thank manchester and new hampshire they 're very special you remember those primaries that primary came around and remember what happened during the primary trump should come in third or fourth and we came in easily number one and that was the beginning that was an easy one i want to thank you all this is incredible and it 's great to be back in a state that i love with thousands of hardworking patriots who are the heart and soul of america and that 's what you are we 're actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of new hampshire in 2020 and i saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media and it said that i 'm tied with three of the other candidates the democrats i 'm tied in new hampshire i do n't think so one of them has a rally he 's got 100 people so this holds 12,000 we 're full and we could fill it up four times at least we could fill it up four times but i just want to thank you all i just think it 's going to be a tremendous four years we 're going to have a tremendous four years can you believe it we only have a little more than a year to go where it all started right the greatest political movement in the history of our country and even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through we have taken this big beautiful ship and it 's being turned around very quickly three years ago we campaigned across the country on a pledge to make america great again and that 's exactly what we 've done i think we can honestly say it 's the greatest slogan in the history of politics in america make america great again so if you do n't mind the other candidates go they spend millions and millions of dollars on this question that i 'm going to ask you they spend millions you remember the first slogan from our opponent that 's right neither do i. neither does anybody nobody remembers the only thing i remember is the first night i went out after i heard it and i said see it 's all about her and they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars it 's all about her that did n't work out too well that slogan was n't too good so we have to do this we have to make a decision do you give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country make america great again right do we give up make america great again for a new slogan because look our country is doing great we are doing very well with china despite the fact that they want to have you believe in the contrary all you have to do is say china how you doing they 're not too happy they 're not too happy they 're losing millions of jobs the tariffs are working and they 're eating the tariffs by the way there 's no price increase you know you got ta talk to these people the fake news but do we give up and by the way the biggest beneficiary you know who have been great our great farmers have been so incredible because they 've been targeted by china and frankly they 've been targeted for a long time including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time so we 're making up for a lot of lost ground but do we give up make america great for keep america great keep america great okay you ready ready i love this because it 's free and we have all the time in the world right is there anything better than a trump rally what about a sleepy joe biden rally well he 's made some beauties i sort of hope it 's him i do n't mind any of them you got pocahontas is rising we got kamala kamala is falling you got beto beto is like gone all right we 'll see what happens whoever it is i do n't know that it matters but whoever it is different different people but i do n't know i think sleepy joe may be able to limp across the finish line but today they announced that they 're going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster they 're going to have fewer appearances you 've heard that right they 're going to cut way back on his appearances can you believe it if i ever did that it would be over the fake news would get us but we do n't let them get us and it is fake and today the deputy editor of the new york times was demoted is n't that beautiful all the news that is not fit to print all the news the fake failing new york times it 's really we it 's not me we 're doing it together they came from the hills they came from the mountains from the rivers they came from all over the place and they showed up and they voted like nobody 's seen before and it was 306 to 223 remember 306 and we won wisconsin and they said oh we never thought of that got to think about those things and we won michigan and now we have a lot of car companies coming into michigan and we have a lot of great farming events happening really big in wisconsin and we have incredible things going on in pennsylvania we just opened up a $ 10 billion plant we have many of them going up many of them a lot of jobs in louisiana an lng plant $ 10 billion could never have happened could never have happened pennsylvania would have never happened they would n't have allowed him to frack so they would 've never been able to build it but what a place that is it will be open in a little more than a year but i have to make a decision it 's a big decision do we give up the greatest theme phrase logo whatever you want to call it in the history of politics risky for a brand new one because make america great again we 're really sort of there and we have a little time left and now we have a group of socialists or communists could be they 're not far away the fake news will hit me on that how dare he say that but they 're not far away right they 're not far away 95 does anybody want to pay 95 taxes i do n't think so but i 'm not going to go into their plan because as far as i 'm concerned the green new deal is a beautiful thing no it 's a beautiful thing we want it to continue onward until about a month before the election i will let them have it like you 've never heard before i do n't want it to change too early it 's like elizabeth warren i did the pocahontas thing i hit her really hard and it looked like she was down and out but that was too long ago i should 've waited but do n't worry we will revive it it can be revived it can be rewritten right it will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly and we 're going to have some fun in the state of new hampshire now what do we do ready let me have first make america great again then keep america great right just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign and there 's a possibility we 'll use both there 's a possibility we 'll use both 'cause i hate like hell to give up the one is it a possibility we 'll use both maybe one a little bit less are you ready so we 'll start make america great again and then keep america are you ready who 's in favor of the campaign theme being make america great again who 's in favor of our theme being keep america great oh wait a minute this is your hat i was going to keep it actually thank you so that 's really been the reaction i 've done this before big crowds and it really is keep america great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us they want to take it away because until a couple of days ago and that 'll catch up very quickly we have no choice by the way i never said china was going to be easy but it 's not tough and they want to make a deal we just spoke to them yesterday they want to make a deal they want to make a deal they have to make a deal and you know what it 'd be wonderful to make a deal i do n't think we 're ready to make a deal we 're taking in billions of dollars in tariffs and again china 's devaluing their currency they 're pouring out money the prices have n't gone up so that means we 're taking in billions of dollars we 're not paying for it and ultimately their devaluations are going to hurt them very badly they want to make a deal and they should want to make a deal but when you listen to the fake news look at how many there are i mean i actually had something today i had something today are we sure that we 're in new hampshire you know you have a reputation i mean i know it 's not true 'cause i know you too well you have a reputation of being very stayed very very elegant stayed incredible people you 're not acting it tonight and that 's good that 's a good thing wow we love our country we have enthusiasm for our country that 's what it is before the election our factories were closing hey who knows it better than you you 're like central casting for the closing of factories our jobs were vanishing our military was totally depleted when i took over our military was sad we were n't flying half of our planes they were old they were tired our equipment was tired our people were n't tired though our people were n't tired but everything we had it was depleted now we 've rebuilt our military like never before and all made in the usa just so you know and our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad they do n't disrespect us anymore folks i got nato to pay an extra hundred billion dollars they were n't paying they were delinquent many nations were except for seven many nations were n't paying what they were supposed to be paying so we 're supposed to protect them they kill us on trade they have all sorts of barriers and everything else the taxes are really unfair the tariffs were ridiculous what they do to us in europe and then we protect them then they do n't pay and i say i 'm sorry folks you have to pay you have to pay they were delinquent they were delinquent and my biggest fan is secretary general stoltenberg from nato he said until president trump came along we were going boom they would 've been finished very quickly but i 'm tired of paying for other nations anyway i have to be honest with you today our nation is stronger than ever before we 're now stronger than ever before you saw we ended the iran disaster how about that we paid them a $ 150 billion $ 1.8 billion in cash cash cash cash we got nothing and they also want to make a deal china wants to make a deal and i will tell you iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them they are not happy so we 'll see how it all turns out but it 's in good hands it 's in good hands the united states right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world we 're rebuilding that awesome might that we were just talking about our united states armed forces america is working again america is winning again and america is respected again respected like never before they respect us again and you see it you know a recent poll came out where it showed that president obama was more popular in germany and other places than i am and i said of course he 's more popular he 's not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide he 's not doing that i 'm doing that and in fact if i was the most popular i 'm not doing my job right so true we 've created over six million new jobs since the election if i would have said that during the campaign those people back there would have been headlines headlines more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps since my election the number of new businesses starting in the great state of new hampshire has skyrocketed by almost 25 and you ca n't really go by my election you got ta go by november 9th because the markets have gone through the roof since november 9th that 's the day after i won the election so i won the election the markets went up thousands of points things started happening you started doing things that you would 've never even though i did n't get sworn in until january 20th but they refused to do that and let me tell you if for some reason i would n't have won the election these markets would have crashed that 'll happen even more so in 2020 see the bottom line is i know you like me and this room is a love fest i know that but you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401ks down the tubes everything 's going to be down the tubes so whether you love me or hate me you got to vote for me i had a businessman the other day one of the most successful guys in the country i 've never liked him never liked him he never liked me i never liked him i see him in the white house i said what are you doing here he said i 'm working to make sure you get elected i said you 've got to be kidding you do n't like me i do n't like you what the hell is this all about he said that 's right we 've had our differences i have n't liked you but to be honest with you mr. president i have no choice i said you 're right you 're right first thing i 've ever heard him say that i agreed with he 's got no choice he got no choice unemployment in new hampshire has reached the lowest rate in actually 31 years but within a very short period of time it will be the lowest rate in the history of our country think of that you have the best unemployment you have the most successful state in the history of your state and in the history of our country and then you 're going to vote for somebody else oh great let 's vote for elizabeth pocahontas warren we have the best numbers we 've ever had let 's vote for somebody else i do n't think that 's going to happen folks i do n't think that 's going to happen only with fixed poles does that happen unemployment for african americans you 've heard me say this many times and i 'm very proud of it hispanic americans and asian americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our county wages are rising quickly remember when i used to say people have been working two and three jobs making less money than they made 21 years ago i used to say it all the time now i can say for the first time in 20 years wages are rising and you know who 's the biggest beneficiary blue collar workers my administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race religion color and creed very important because we are all americans we all share the same home we all share the same heart we all share the same dreams we are all children of the same almighty god but at the very moment when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings the radical democrats are trying to tear america apart they vilify anyone who does n't share their extreme views they slander our law enforcement heroes you see what they 're doing with our police that we love you see what they 're doing has anyone ever seen anything like the water being thrown on new york 's finest have you ever seen and i know a lot of new york 's finest they 're not happy they 're not happy and they are great people these are great great proud people for that to be allowed to happen is a disgrace they view everybody as fascist and nazis they used the term nazi this was a term you could n't even use it now they use it like on a regular basis nazi he 's a nazi think of that he 's a nazi you could n't use it now they use it they accuse our heroic border agents of running concentration camps and they do an incredible job and the democrats do n't want to fix the loopholes or asylum they do an incredible job our border agents and they looked down upon the hardworking citizens who truly make our country run but while the democrats rage and resist that guy 's got a serious weight problem go home start exercising get him out of here please you got a bigger problem than i do got a bigger problem than all of us now he goes home and his mom says what the hell have you just done we are continuing our incredible movement the greatest political movement in the history of our country there 's never been a movement like this never our movement is built on love and it is and we love our family we love our faith we love our flag and we love our freedom and that 's what it 's about and add to that the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our- the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our country together we are all united by one fundamental principal a nation 's first duty must always be to its own citizens it 's own we 've got to take care of our own you have n't heard that from a politician or a political leader in a long time it 's called america first it 's america first we 're thrilled to be joined tonight by many tremendous republican leaders and great friends of mine a man who 's doing an incredible job as your governor because i want to take 100 of the credit for the incredible turnaround of new hampshire and i remember it not so long ago things were not looking good people were leaving a lot of bad things were happening but we have to give him a lot of credit he 's been a great governor chris sununu with a great father too great father with a great father his father was tough chris your father was so tough he was for somebody else in the primaries and then one by one i won here i won there i won there and then when i won his father got on and i said oh this guy kills me he 's so tough and he said president trump will be the greatest of all time i said what happened what happened he went from being the toughest critic to the best there is so i want to say hello to your father okay chris you 'll tell him great guy what a family what a family thank you for chris new hampshire senate republican leader chuck morse chuck thanks chuck new hampshire house republican leader dick hinch thank you dick thank you dick great job a man who was with me right from the beginning in fact he had a meeting at his house his house has never been the same his house is a disaster now like somebody said he just sold it but you know what because of the trump economy i 'll bet he sold it for a big big fat beautiful profit where is steve steve stepanek and his wife who 's incredible did you make a lot of money on the house we destroyed the house this was the beginning he held some kind of a meeting for me and he has a nice house but literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up and they destroyed his house it 's never been the same no wonder you sold it they finally gave up and that was four years ago anyway thank you very much both for being here i appreciate it what great people thank you steve great job and i hope the buyer of his house did n't hear that little steve i hope the buyer did n't hear what i just said about your house he 'll cancel that 's all right you 'll sell it for more to somebody else do n't worry republican party chair ronna mcdaniel you know ronna headed up michigan and for many many years nobody won michigan as a republican but i used to complain i 'd go there and i 'd say they 're stealing your car business i 'd go for years in fact five or six years before i even thought about running for whatever reason they named me man of the year in michigan i said how come i did n't even understand it myself but i was named man of the year i was n't even political that was years before i did this but i was always complaining that our car business is being stolen i mean it 's sort of obvious right mexico now has 32 of our car business it all left the state of michigan we are bringing it back at a level that nobody 's ever seen before our car business but i went to michigan and my opponent was told that the republicans no way you can win michigan or wisconsin that you just ca n't and we had a campaign manager named ronna mcdaniel and ronna would n't stop sir can you be here next week i say i do n't know then i leave and she said sir can you come back in three days i said i do n't know then i do it and she said how about another time and then on election night she said sir it was six o'clock the day before the election in other words just a short while before the election she calls me sir can you be here tonight i said tonight and by the way you know where i was i was in new hampshire that 's right she said sir can you be here tonight i said are you sure i started speaking at one o'clock in the morning now it 's election day we had 32,000 people show up it was like this the crowd was just they want to see things happen in our country they love our country it went crazy i left and i said i do n't know why going to lose michigan why would we lose michigan look at this the opponent went there with barack obama and michelle obama and she went there much earlier prime time one o'clock two o'clock in the morning is not exactly prime time we had 32,000 and they had a tiny little crowd and i looked at my people and i said i know we 're not supposed to win the great state of michigan but i think we 're going to win michigan and we won michigan and we won wisconsin we won wisconsin wisconsin was a great victory and we won pennsylvania and we won north carolina and south carolina and we won florida and i hate to tell you we should 've won new hampshire that was taken away new hampshire was taken away it was taken away from us but we should 've we did great in new hampshire we should 've won new hampshire but that 's okay i 'm not holding it against you because it was not your fault but we had a woman in michigan and i said when it came time to choosing the head of the republican national committee i said who the hell is that woman up in michigan that got me to keep coming there and explaining that we ca n't continue to lose our car business we have 17 companies now coming back in who is that woman and it was ronna we put her in charge of the republican national committee the job that she has done is incredible thank you the same with another man our campaign manager he started off as a computer genius and remember when they used to say that the hillary clinton campaign is highly sophisticated highly she did a lot of bad things folks 33,000 emails deleted after getting a subpoena from the united states congress 33,000 remember she said it was about her daughter 's wedding and yoga classes 33,000 yes it was disgraceful i will tell you this we now have a great attorney general a fair guy a great gentleman another man who 's here tonight is the world 's tallest campaign manager he is an unbelievable talent but they were saying about our opponents i 'm not going to mention the name again because we 'll never get it finished here so i 'll just say my opponent is that better they were saying how sophisticated her campaign was except ours was far more sophisticated and we had a man that did an incredible job he 's now our campaign manager and he 's one of the tallest human beings i 've ever seen his name is brad parscale and he is fantastic it 's nice when you do n't have to look for anybody you just look over and you see a guy who 's twice as tall as everyone great job brad thank you how we doing brad good doing good got great poll numbers we 've got great poll numbers in a lot of states ohio iowa you know iowa every week that they campaign our numbers go up they 're winning iowa we gave them ethanol which is very important a lot of things for iowa but every week we seem to be going up in iowa because they 're campaigning in iowa wherever they go our numbers go up somebody 's going to have to explain that one to me someday but we like it a man who 's a friend of mine who was the greatest mayor in the history of new york city stand up rudy stand up rudy rudy giuliani man he did a job in the first year i 've never seen anything like it new york was crime infested we had problems we had problems like nobody would believe rudy went in there and he did the job and people loved him for it it was n't like oh gee he 's a horrible person people loved rudy giuliani he was a great great mayor so thank you rudy for being here the first person that i put on on the campaign he was driving me wild he said i 'm saying you can win sir you can win i 'm telling you you can win he loves this state he 's from this state he said you can win sir i 'm just telling you i had him on for month after month he 'd come drive me crazy he 'd say you can win you can win you can win and finally we said let 's give it a shot and i had corey i had hope i had just a couple of people we had a rather lean and mean staff but corey lewandowski loves your state loves new hampshire he was the first one that talked about us possibly winning the whole big ballgame he 's tough and he 's smart and i 'm hearing he 's thinking about running for the senate from new hampshire there we go i think he 'd be tough to beat i 'll tell you one thing he 'll go into washington and he 's going to have you in mind he 's going to do a job if he does do it so we 'll see what happens he has n't made up his mind yet but he would be fantastic i guess it 's something you go back and you talk to your family you talk to your wife and you make a decision they 're all saying are you going to support him i said i do n't know if he 's running so corey let us know please if you do n't mind let us know our shared republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs pro family pro growth and 100 pro american for decades and decades the permanent politicians in washington pursued the very opposite they sold out our workers you see it you know it better than any place when i talk about the horrors of nafta the horrors of trade deals i mean i 'm sorry to tell you this i usually refer to new hampshire nobody took it worse than new england and nobody took it worse than new hampshire now here 's the good news i would never let that happen again and chris will never let that happen again is there a doctor please doctor in the house thank you doctor in the house please doctor please thank you very much take your time yeah take your time thank you take your time fellas plenty of time you know people got here two and a half days ago many of these people in the front right two and a half days ago a lot of these people so you can understand it 's pretty tough thank you thank you that 's okay these are great people these are great people that love our country just remember that thank you very much thank you thank you very much pretty good pretty good so our politicians shipped away our jobs shed our sovereignty surrendered our dignity and saddled our nation in one foreign debacle after another and we 're still here he just said it we 're still here you better believe it and we 're here stronger than ever before we 're here but all of that ended the day that i took the oath of office the american people are in charge of their country again we cut a record number of job killing regulations that were strangling our country we cut more regulations in two and a half years than any other president in their full terms four years eight years or in one case more than that cut more than anybody to get relief to working families we passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country you 're making a lot more money you 're making a lot more money and you see it and you know it because you see it in your paycheck every week we ended the last administration 's cruel war on american energy and we are delivering a policy of american energy independence like you 've never seen before in fact if you look at the straits where we 're having all of the problems you look at the straits number one they 're not touching our ships they 're not playing with our ships they 're taking them from this country from that country from that country but you know what very importantly we have very few ships going there anymore because we do n't need that oil and gas the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world every leading democrat has pledged abolish the american oil coal and natural gas industries that are fueling our economic boom can you imagine this we 're sitting on great wealth they want to take it away from us and the alternatives do n't have the power they do n't have the power they want wind wind wind is oh so beautiful as long as you do n't have to stare at a windmill and your house goes down in value like to nothing steve if you had a windmill anywhere near your house you would 've gotten one third of the price you got steve that 's true by the way steve 's too smart to let that happen we wo n't let them take it away from you we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that shattered new hampshire and your factories they shattered your communities and they shattered american power and american prestige all around the globe new hampshire lost one in four manufacturing jobs following nafta and china 's entrance into the organization two of the worst deals ever in the history of our world not just our country election after election politicians came to your state pretending to have the courage to stand up for the american worker then they went to washington and let other countries push them around and special interests buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies that 's what happened me i do n't care about their campaign contributions it does n't matter to me folks we want to do a job we want to do a great job and we 're setting records and you know who 's sending us the money the small donors well we have big donors but we have small donors are sending us the money for the election pretty amazing that 's not supposed to happen to a republican but it 's happening to this republican and it 's happening to you every vow that politicians made was broken every hope was dashed and every promise turned into a total betrayal of new hampshire and of our country but in this administration we have something those sell out politicians could only dream of it 's called strength and commitment we do n't play games we do n't play games after years and years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country standing up for our jobs our workers and standing up for our dignity the forgotten men and women of america will never ever be forgotten again you were forgotten the last administration with sleepy joe and obama tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated worse than nafta worse than wto it was called the trans pacific partnership it would have been a disaster tpp would have gutted the american auto industry it would have been in shambles our auto industry is coming back so strong it would 've gutted would 've destroyed the industry but in my first week in office i proudly withdrew the united states from that job destroying catastrophe we 're imposing beautiful well placed tariffs money comes in on foreign countries that cheat our workers steal our jobs and break all the rules i 'm sorry and by the way they 've been changing and charging tariffs on us for years we have countries that charge us 100 200 297 in the case of canada with your farm products we 're not going to stand for it and man did we turn things around and we 've just started if companies do n't want to pay a tariff i have one simple solution come make your product in america come make your product in new hampshire zero tariffs zero no tariff together we 're restoring this nation 's industrial might and we are doing it with american iron american aluminum and american steel we 're doing it steel steel industry is high they were dumping steel all over they were destroying our companies us steel now all of them they 're all expanding the steel industry is back it 's doing great we 're opening up mines in minnesota the great state of minnesota they have magnificent mines that have the best iron ore in the world and president obama closed them down maybe we can get representative omar from minnesota to open it up but i do n't think so she 'll open them up i do n't think so representative omar that 's another one we 're replacing nafta with the brand new usmca that 's mexico and canada great deal the usmca will create countless jobs for farmers and manufacturers all across the state we need congress to pass the usmca immediately we 'll make it a bipartisan deal we do n't even want credit the unions benefit the non unions benefit everybody benefits it brings it back to fairness and it makes it very hard for our companies to leave our countries go to mexico or canada we lose all our jobs we lose all our taxes we end up with empty factories and plants it makes it almost impossible we 're not going to have that that was my one rule that i had to have it 's going to be very very hard for companies to do that i 've also taken the toughest ever action to stand up to china 's chronic trade abuses earlier this month the us government officially labeled china for the first time ever a currency manipulator another promise kept while others allowed china to freely loot the us economy $ 500 billion a year not million not million billion with a b. we 've made it clear that the theft of american jobs and american wealth is over yet today the wall street journal editorial board and some others continue to publish foolish articles that demonstrate that they understand nothing about trade or business nothing they advocate only economic surrender they actually say go to china take off the tariffs make a deal i lose all the cards we take off the tariffs we do n't have any cards think of it they say go to europe by the way the european union is worse than china just smaller it treats us horribly barriers tariffs taxes and we let them come in it 's worse than china many of us come from there i do that 's what it 's got going that 's about it they treat us really badly and many others many many others india tariffs us probably higher than any nation anywhere in the world we have tariffs of 100 on products and much more than that india so we 're working on all of them i called prime minister modi i said mr. prime minister it 's not fair we 've got to change we 've got to change we 've got to change and we 're talking to them very seriously we 're talking to a lot of places but when the wall street journal comes out and they say no no take the tariffs go and talk to china they 've been trying to talk to them for 25 years but actually you know what they really have n't the fact is the leaders that were in my position they did n't do a damn thing they did n't talk they did n't talk past leaders followed the terrible advice of these editorial boards that are frankly totally inexperienced in business i guess and our industries were utterly decimated globalism enriches foreign countries at our expense globalism i love our country i 'm the president of the united states of america i 'm not the president of the the world as long as i 'm president america will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many years as we restore our prosperity we are also restoring public safety we are fighting to reduce violent crime you see so much and over the last 25 years so much crime and ensure that every american can live in safety and peace and yet with all that you see we 've had one of the best years of crime prevention that we 've ever had it would n't seem that way but it is one of the best years because those gentlemen that we just saw the law enforcement they do a great job you 've been reading about this a lot lately we are working very hard to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of insane people and those who are mentally sick and should n't have guns but people have to remember however that there is a mental illness problem that has to be dealt with it 's not the gun that pulls the trigger it 's the person holding the gun years ago many cities and states i remember it so well closed mental institutions for budgetary reasons they let those people out onto the street you probably have your examples up here i can tell you in new york they closed so many of them and they let really seriously mentally ill people out on the streets and you see plenty of them today even today we 're going to have to give major consideration to building new facilities for those in need we have to do it and at the same time we will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off of mentally deranged and dangerous people off of the streets so we wo n't have to worry so much about that the big problem we do n't have those institutions anymore and people ca n't get proper care they 're seriously ill people and they 're on the streets we ca n't make it harder for good solid law abiding citizens to protect themselves we will always uphold the right to self defense and we will always uphold the second amendment we will so important one of the most powerful promises i made to the people of this state was to confront the opioid and drug epidemic i used to go around new hampshire more than any state and you 'd say sir the state is infested you said sir we 'll like a drug den you tell me and i did n't really see it and then i met with the police officers and fire departments and all the people that do and you just seem to have a bigger problem and by the way the wall is being built that's- that 's going to stop a lot of it the wall is being built build the wall build the wall build the wall build the wall build the wall build the wall build the wall it 's being built you know we have the fake news you know about that where they a wall that 's lying on the ground in a very important section so we pick up the wall it 's in pieces i mean literally it 's gone and we build a brand new 30 foot steel and concrete wall and the fake media said he did n't build a wall that 's just renovation there was no wall it 's lying on the ground people walk right over and it 's rotted rusted gone we take it away we put a brand new wall up they give me no credit you know why because they 're fake news that 's why we 're building a lot of walls the army corps of engineers is doing a great job they 're doing a great job since i took office we 've attacked the challenge with everything we have we have secured a record $ 6 billion in new funding opioid we vastly increase the distribution of overdose reversing drugs which are pretty amazing things we 've given them to your police department your fire department pretty amazing we have reduced the total amount of opioids prescribed by 34 the department of justice has prosecuted more than 3000 defendants in opioids related cases and our public awareness campaign about the terrible suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58 of all young americans i said that you have to show them we 're doing ads beautiful ads shows them and you 've seen them i do n't even want to describe them they 're brutal but we 're doing ads on television and papers about how bad it is for children so they can see it because the greatest thing we can do is not get people started on drugs right not get them started it 's hard to get off you know we can get them off and we 're doing it and it 's been done but it 's hard to get off if they never start it 's real easy it 's real easy so we 're trying to get young kids you wo n't see the fruits of this labor for a little while because it takes a while but we 're really we are working so hard on advertising and promotions to tell young kids children how bad drugs are how dangerous they are how horrible they are how they destroy your brain how they do so many bad things and they 're really very tough ads they 're hard hitting ads and i think they 're having a big impact you 'll see over time you 'll see over time you 'll see but we still have much work to do but as a result of these efforts last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in 31 years that 's pretty amazing and at the center of america 's drug crisis is the border crisis vast quantities of deadly narcotics are being smuggled across the border including meth cocaine heroin and fentanyl and as part of my trade deal with china it 's been very important and president xi said he 's going to do it so far he has not done it but i said you have to stop sending us fentanyl have to and you have to criminalize in china the making of fentanyl and so far he has not come through but i think he will you 'll know you 'll know yet democrats want to open borders and republicans want strong borders that you 're difference one wants open borders who can even think of an open border think of it even though many people that come into our country are wonderful people they 're are still coming in illegally they 're not coming in through merit but what about the bad ones we have serious serious criminals that want to come in and if we had open borders they would be flowing in like you 've never seen before democrats want open borders they do n't mind crime we do mind crime and that 's the way it is democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities last year alone sanctuary cities declined more than 17,000 requests from federal authorities to hand over criminal aliens already in their custody in other words 17,000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into us communities you do n't understand even what the hell are they doing what are they doing 17,000 republicans believe our city should be sanctuaries for law abiding americans not for criminal aliens we will always support the amazing heroes of ice and border patrol and we will always support law enforcement every democrat candidate also wants to give illegal immigrants free welfare republicans believe public benefits should be protected for truly needy americans not for illegal aliens and we should reduce our taxes and many other things with all of that money that we 're talking about we need to elect a strong republican majority to end sanctuary cities stop human traffickers stop drug smugglers and adopt an immigration system that puts the needs of american workers and families first it 's also time for democrats to join with us to protect the sacred integrity of our elections by supporting voter id voter identification it 's incredible they 're constantly saying oh we need to protect them but they 're not looking for that they 're not looking for that we say what about voter id in other words you have a picture you have to go up what about voter id that they do n't want to do but we need voter id the democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream where do they come from you know you say you want low taxes good education strong military strong borders you want to have safe homes you want a house you want low interest rates you 've got low hey you got low interest rates the lowest ever got low rates it 's a good time to refinance your house by the way great time you got everything and then you see these people they 're against they have no idea what they 're doing they have no idea what they 're against every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid medicare and destroy the private health insurance plans of millions of american families that they love my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you the individual mandate is gone the most unpopular part of obamacare and we almost have obamacare gone we 're close we would have had it before but we had a vote that was a little bit surprising i 'm sure none of you knew who that vote was we had it done repealed and replaced but it 's going to happen and i think it 's going to actually be in the end actually better you watch so we got rid of the individual mandate which was the most unpopular part of obamacare and we 're running it better you know i had a political decision do i make it great alex azar our secretary do rerun it well and sort of say hey we run it well or do we run it badly and have everybody upset we said we got to run it well but it 's still much too expensive it 's lousy healthcare but we got rid of the worst part of it individual mandate individual mandate where you have the privilege of buying the right not to have to pay for expensive insurance that 's no good health insurance and we wo n't and you got to remember this republicans and i speak for every one of them we will always protect pre existing conditions we 're going to protect always right got to do it our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in 51 years the only decline in 51 years we have launched a historic initiative to require price transparency empowering you to choose the lowest price for yourself and for your family believe it or not you did n't have the right to go in and price your drugs who could even believe this i wonder if big pharma had something to do with that so we 're going to have transparency virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up up till right up until the moment of birth and in the case of the virginia governor he 's having a rough rough time in his case the baby is born and then he goes to talk to the mother the doctor talks to the mother the baby is now born wrapped as he said and then they decide whether or not to execute the baby who would believe that that is why i 've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred the gift of god hard to believe is n't that democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and socialism the republican party is the party of freedom we are the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream and i 'm fighting for you each and every day so importantly we have confirmed more than 140 federal judges within 90 days it will be 179 federal judges thank you very much president obama thank you very much i do n't know what happened to them but i came to office and i had 138 judges that were not appointed by president obama so i say thank you mr. president very good and they 'll say he was a great president oh the fake news he was a great president if he was a great president how come he left me 138 judges to appoint when everybody says that 's the single most important thing a president of the united states has to do great president he was great he was a great president and these judges will apply the law as written including we appointed two great supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh and to help patients with life threatening illnesses we also pass something i 'm so proud of 44 years they could n't get it passed right to try you can use our newest our best medicines incredible what 's happening i 'm so proud of that and this from forever five decades we pass for our great veterans va choice and va accountability and one of our great friends was a veteran who 's been with me in new hampshire i do n't know where you are where 's our guy where is he so al so i walk in i said hello he 's been with me from the beginning he was n't with he liked trump and i came in he said sir he 's a great veteran he said sir i have cancer and sir i went into the vet they were very very late they had problems i 'm not blaming them but they gave me the right to go out and get a great cancer surgeon he had his operation you look much better than you did three years ago al much better much better va choice right al va choice great story thank you very much and thank you for your loyalty he 's been to every rally i ever gave a new hampshire right from the beginning i got so tired of looking at him he 'd always be here now he 's look at him now he 's sitting in very good that 's good but i appreciate that story i appreciate va choice just makes sense right does n't it make sense we 've achieved record funding for the united states military $ 716 billion $ 700 billion and $ 738 billion and it 's almost completely rebuilt including and we hope to god we never have do use it we have the finest most powerful nuclear capability anywhere on the face of the earth and i hope to god we never have to use it we 're investing in the future of human space flight and someday soon american astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on the surface of mars i told my guys at nasa you know nasa when we took it over it was exhausted the runways and the grounds had all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete you would n't recognize it now it 's beautiful it 's the best place anywhere on earth and i also said though you know i hear all these rich guys for some reason they love space so they 're rich i said let them send the rockets up what the hell do we have to do it right so i see jeff bezos and elon musk they 're putting rockets up i think it 's great and they pay us rent they use our facility that 's great but we 're also doing it and nasa has some of the greatest plans we 've ever had these are great people great scientists but we also let the private sector put up rockets the one which recently went up and you see the engines coming back down and they coming there 's no wings no nothing it 's almost like what are we watching is this fiction and they come down and they save all of the propellants all of the really the most expensive parts they 're able to save it by bringing it back right to where it took off who would think they could do this i never saw this before six months ago but they 're doing it now more and more they 're saving a lot of the most important and expensive parts of rockets so we have a lot of rich guys paying us a lot of rent but we 're also doing it ourselves to protect america 's security i withdrew the united states from the horrible one sided iran nuclear deal i recognized israel 's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem and just three months ago we also recognized the golan heights as being a part of and protected by israel for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of new hampshire thank you and you must never forget the 2020 election right around the corner 2020 right around the corner and it 's about one thing you know what the one thing is you it 's about you it 's about your family it 's about your future and it 's about the fate of your country so when we ran together last time we said the most importantly we had to turn it around this country was going bad you see what happened to venezuela with socialism venezuela 15 years ago was one of the richest countries now they do n't have water they do n't have food they do n't have anything and this was one of the richest nations in the world they do n't have anything we 're working on it we 're helping people but it 's very sad it 's never going to happen to us because we will never ever be a socialist nation ever no matter what label they use a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction the destruction of the american dream we have a dream it 's a great dream this the destruction of the american dream we begin this campaign tonight with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of new hampshire and for the people of america together we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity millions and millions of people with your help we will elect a republican congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration we will enact trade deals that are already happening that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine ending the aids epidemic in america and finding new cures for childhood cancer something i never thought i 'd be able to say within one decade the aids epidemic in the united states will be gone think of that did you ever think you were going to hear that no did you ever think you were going to hear that the work they 've done on aids is incredible that 's an incredible thing when they told me that it 's just shattering it just it breaks your heart what 's happened but think of it in 10 years the aids epidemic will be eradicated so great who thought that was going to be happening who thought i 'd be able to get to say that so early in what we 're doing together we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together there is one america we will support protect and defend the constitution of the united states we 'll stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy
